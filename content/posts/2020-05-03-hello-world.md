Better late than never, I guess. For all of you who've stumbled onto my blog: Welcome! Your visitation will earn you a finite, but non-negligible amount of esoteric and arcane thoughts from a single drop in the ocean of consciousness.

It seems that the trend of my chosen profession, software engineering, is toward the promotion of one's knowledge and body of work using a personal website. So, for both 1) developing my career and 2) having an outlet for the incessant stream of information rattling around in my meat computer I have created the site you've visited today.

Finally, thank you again for visiting and please enjoy your time here.

P.S. I want to give voice to the kind contributors to the
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Hermit](https://github.com/Track3/hermit) projects for accelerating my personal website's development.
