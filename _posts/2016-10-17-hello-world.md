<span class="emphasis-text"> Welcome, reader. </span> This has been a long time
coming and I'm happy to finally be putting my thoughts online. I fully expect to
make myriads of layout changes over the years as I (hopefully) continue to add
fresh content my site. As of the time of this writing my blog is hosted on
[theline.design]( https://theline.design ). I hope to have this domain for some
time.

I believe I have done a disservice both to myself (mostly) and those who know me
(less-ly) to delay the authoring of my thoughts. Don't misinterpret me, though.
I would never claim to be the thinker of the greatest of thoughts.
However, I do believe that my blog can and will benefit both myself and those
who care about the things I have to say. This blog benefits *me* in that
 * my thoughts worth keeping might not escape me,
 * my academic research can be expounded,
 * I can share a common core of my inner self with others.

 Those are the selfish reasons. But, I think that this blog might also serve a
 more humanitarian purpose, too. You see, currently I spend a lot of my time
 telling my girlfriend and my friends about a lot of the small stuff going on in
 my life. They can do without that. This blog will allow me to share my thoughts
 with a whole other group of people. And, if my girlfriend or my friends still
 want to peek inside my brain then they can just look here. For the friends that
 I don't keep up with or for my family (who I definitely don't spend enough time
 with) this is a way to stay in contact with some vestige of me.

 Now, I want to talk about something that's been on my mind for a while: Time
 management. It's something that I think most adults struggle with. Children
 don't seem to have this obligation (if they do, they seem to disregard it). To
 that end, I want to do some analysis on my time management.

 Consider my life to be
 divided into a few categories that, in my mind, all deserve attention.
 * Research
 * Physical fitness (diet, exercise, biorhythms, etc.)
 * Long-term Projects (more information to come)
 * Short-term projects (see above)
 * Self-exploration
 * Socialization

The list above is not hierarchical. If I were to form a hierarchy based on how I
believe my time most ought to be spent then I suppose it would look like
 1. Research - 30% of my time
 1. Physical fitness (diet, exercise, biorhythms, etc.) - 20%
 1. Socialization - 25%
 1. Long-term Projects (more information to come) - 10%
 1. Short-term projects (see above) - 10%
 1. Self-exploration - 5%.

But, I think that my time is spent more like the following
 1. Short-term projects (see above) - 30%
 1. Long-term Projects (more information to come) - 30%
 1. Physical fitness (diet, exercise, biorhythms, etc.) - 20%
 1. Socialization - 15%
 1. Research - 4% of my time
 1. Self-exploration - 1%.

My time is clearly not divided in an appropriate manner: I admit it. Okay, so
people are awake for about 8 hours a day. That leaves 16 hours to do things.
Some time needs to be spent on making food, on personal hygiene
(beautification), commuting, on errands/chores. Imagine that 2 hours every day
are spent making food, 1 hour is spent on personal hygiene, 1 hour is spent
commuting and that 1 hour (on average) is spent doing errands/chores. That's 5
hours of time that can not be spent on any of the above categories, which each
deserve their own time. So, with only 11 hours left to do "productive" things
let's compare how I would ideally spend my productive time with how I actually
spend my productive time.

<table>
   <tr>
      <th> Category </th>
      <th> Ideal Hours (%) </th>
      <th> Actual Hours (%) </th>
      <th> Deficit </th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Research</td>
      <td>3.3 (30)</td>
      <td>.44 (4)</td>
      <td>2.86 </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Physical fitness</td>
      <td>2.2 (20)</td>
      <td>2.2 (20)</td>
      <td>0</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Socialization</td>
      <td>2.75 (25)</td>
      <td>1.65 (15)</td>
      <td>1.10</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Long-term projects</td>
      <td>1.1 (10)</td>
      <td>3.3 (30)</td>
      <td>-2.2</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Short-term projects</td>
      <td>1.1 (10)</td>
      <td>3.3 (30)</td>
      <td>-2.2</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Self-exploration</td>
      <td>.55 (5)</td>
      <td>.11 (1)</td>
      <td>.44</td>
   </tr>
</table>

Apparently, there's a serious deficiency in the amount of time that I spend
researching and socializing. This time is originating from the time that I
invest in my personal projects. This is something that needs to change. This has
been an issue that I've had for some time. I always want to finish a project
before I start anything else. As an example, consider one project that's been
directly hindering my research.

*Commencing Introspection...*

I want to finish the entire design of my website before I put a blog post up.

And, I want to put up a blog post about my research before I commit to advancing my
research.

But, in order to finish my website I need to select a good graphing library (D3,
Google Charts, Plotly, etc.) in case I ever need a good plot of.... something.
It should be able to generate heat maps, time series, pie charts, it should be
interactive, it should use two-way data binding, it should... Well, I still
haven't picked out a good graphing library.

Okay, so I won't get a good graphing library. But, I should at least finalize the CSS for
my website. My resume is looking a bit shoddy and it's still not generating a
PDF in the browser very well. Also, my sidebar is a bit blas&eacute;. Also, I wanted
to include that visualization tool that would allow you to view my posts by date
and by content. The user will mouse over an axis representing time and the posts from
around that time will be displayed as hollow circles of different size
(proportional to post length) and color (category).

Okay, I'll need to develop a database back-end so that I can filter posts by
date and by category. I can use this opportunity to learn about the latest NoSQL
databases. But, I'll probably just end up using SQLite because, well, it will
work just fine and I can store it in the repository of the website. But, maybe I
want to create a script that will generate the SQLite database so that I don't
have to keep that blob in the Git repository.

So, at this point I have generated the two following chains of (really)
inconsequential events that need to occur prior to the completion of an
(actually) important event, my research:

1. graphing library → blog →
research.
1. database → weird visualization tool → blog →
research.

*Introspection Terminated*

So, you can see why, maybe, it's taken so long for this blog to come alive.
There are still other parts of my life that have yet to come alive. But, I'm
glad that at least this blog is finally here. I still don't have a great layout
(my sidebar is trash) and I still don't have a database picked out. I won't be
making charts any time soon, hopefully. I guess I'm learning to just do the
things that I need to do when I need to do them. It's hard not finishing each
project before you move on to the next one - at least, it is for me. But, if I
don't take action now and learn to re-prioritize the events in my life that need
doing, then I'll end up never getting anything done.

In a lot of ways, I feel like my work cycle is reflective of my learning pattern.
I am a trained electrical engineer who got tired of cheap engineering courses
that tried to act like science courses. So, I took more and more physics courses
that did satisfy my curious mind. But, learning physics exposed me to advanced
mathematics - like linear algebra as a way to see life, not as an engineering
tool, or like real analysis or Lie algebras - and a bit of computer numerical
work.

Both of those fields - mathematics and computer science - are rabbit holes
that I invested a lot of my life in. Outside of my curricular time I would study
data structures (binary trees, heaps, stacks, hash tables), algorithms (sort
algorithms, recursion algorithms), language design (static vs. dynamic typing,
interpreted vs. compiled, just-in-time compilation, low-level virtual machines),
real and complex analysis, linear algebra, the list goes on and on. Sadly, I've
forgotten most of the stuff that I've learned. I credit a lot of that to poor
documentation (i.e. no blog) and to the disuse of much of that information.

This learning pattern is very dangerous. It can take one away from ever really
learning something by spreading their time over every topic. It is very
difficult to determine exactly how much should be known about the topics related
to the one at hand. How deep down the rabbit hole do you go when you're trying
to solve a problem or generalize one that you've already solved? This is a
struggle that I imagine most scientists experience. The quest for knowledge can
be never-ending. You can spend your whole life studying introductory concepts
from every field, or you can spend your life mastering one branch. Both are
perilous in some ways. The one who masters one branch is weak in his ability to
apply his knowledge to knew problems and situations. The one who spent his whole
life studying introductory concepts never really advanced the knowledge of
mankind.

These issues, time management and topical discursions, are those features that
most limit my advancement in my field. I acknowledge it. I'm hoping that this
blog might focus my mind on the most important things. By documenting my
thoughts I give myself the opportunity to return to topics I want to consider.
In order to correct for my time management I'm committed to using a calendar. I
will do my best to adhere to a work schedule as well as possible. It's hard to
do when you miss a bus or take a long lunch or stay up late one night, but it
has to be done. It's a matter of principle, staying on task, and I'm tired of
not accomplishing as much as I want.
